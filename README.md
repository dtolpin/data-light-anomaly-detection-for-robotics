# Case studies for the "Data-light anomaly detection for robotics" paper

The data sets are in the `data/` folder. The code for the case studies is
in Julia Pluto notebooks:

* `solution.jl` --- the method proposed in the paper.
* `baselines.jl` --- outlier detection baselines.
* `counts-exploration.jl` --- comparison of pooled vs. KNN by runs vs. KNN by second for counts.
* `ks-ws-kl.jl` --- comparison of distances between count vectors.
